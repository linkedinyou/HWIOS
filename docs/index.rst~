About HWIOS
===========
The Hybrid Web IO System framework is a general purpose realtime collaborative platform, specialized in serving realtime information to
web-clients through extensive use of websocket and routing technology. The framework is mostly written in Python and Javascript on top of
frameworks like Twisted, Django and Jquery. HWIOS can be used to create async networked applications for the web, including realtime cms-software,
networked games, messaging applications, etc.. HWIOS is capable of serving multiple twisted services at once, which means that other network
services can be used to relay data to web-clients. An example of this can be found in the distributed service management implementation called
Teknon. Read on for more information about the project's background:
