Notification systems
====================
The HWIOS framework provides some preliminary helpers that make automated notification to clients easier. There is a rough distinction
between message-notification, view-notification and scripted notification.


Message notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The activity widget is meant to notify users of other user's actions. The code is generally called within a websocket controller view,
and sends a message-notification of the action together with a link as an activity-widget update to an involved client-group.
This method is used when you want users to be more aware of each other's actions in certain parts of the application,
without distracting them too much. If you want a more obvious message notification, use the status response which triggers a
pop-up widget notification.

   :members:
   :show-inheritance:

View notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of the time, when the content of a page changes, it's desired that other user's are aware of this change as well. The notification
code can be used to trigger a view update to a participating group of clients, even when their authentication levels and views are different.

.. automodule:: services.web_ui.models.notifications
   :members:
   :show-inheritance:

Scripted notification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The plasmoids scripting system is a moderator-accessible javascripting-environment, that can be used to deliver small javascript-widgets
to groups of users, based on view and/or authentication level. See the wiki-plasmoid for an example. This kind of notification is more
like a persistent functionality expansion, but can be seen as a type of notification as well...
