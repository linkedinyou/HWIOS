Infinote OT
===========

The Operational transformation based infinote protocol became usable for the web, after the MIT-licensed
javascript implementation jinfinote (http://www.jinfinote.com/) hit the web. HWIOS uses jinfinote on the clientside.
A python port of jinfinote has been developed to keep track of the common document state on the serverside. Both together
form the OT-based editing system that's available in HWIOS.
