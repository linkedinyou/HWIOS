About the HWIOS project
=======================
The Hybrid Web IO System framework is a general purpose realtime collaborative platform, specialized in serving realtime information to
web-clients through extensive use of websocket and routing technology. The framework is written in Python and Javascript on top of
frameworks like Twisted, Django and Jquery. HWIOS can be used to create async networked applications for the web, including realtime cms-software,
networked games, messaging applications, etc.. HWIOS is capable of serving multiple twisted services at once, which means that other network
services can be used to relay data to web-clients. An example of this can be found in the distributed service management implementation called
Teknon. Please visit the [documentation area](http://hwios.org/docs/ "HWIOS Docs") for more information about HWIOS. For the most recent
tech-demo, visit the [community area](http://hwios.org "HWIOS Community") with a websocket-compatible html5 browser.
Chrome or Chromium is strongly advised at the moment. Other browsers may not work at all(IE), or require manual intervention in the browser
configuration currently(FF4, Opera 11).
